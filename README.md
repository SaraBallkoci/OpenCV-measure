## Distance Measurement Tool

This script allows users to measure the distance between two points on an image in both pixels and millimeters using OpenCV. The tool displays the image and lets the user click on two points to define the measurement. It then calculates and draws the distance between these points on the image, displaying the results in pixels and millimeters.

## Key Features:

1. Click on two points in the image to measure the distance between them.
2. Displays the distance in both pixels and millimeters.
3. Visualizes the measured distance on the image with a line and text annotations.

## How to Use:

1. Ensure you have OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy installed.
2. Replace 'tooth.jpeg' with the path to your image.
3. Run the script.
4. Click on two points in the displayed image to measure the distance.
